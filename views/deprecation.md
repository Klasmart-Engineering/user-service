## API Deprecation

Many areas of the API are deprecated in favor of more secure, performant & scalable alternatives.

These old APIs are due to be removed from the service. They are marked as `@deprecated` on the API, along with sunset dates
and links to the [deprecation documentation on confluence](https://calmisland.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/UserService/pages/2462417813), which includes migration guides.
